# The preceding example is split over two lines for readability.

#The script reads in a file called princnames. This file contains principal names and their passwords, and adds them to the #Kerberos database.

#You would have to create the princnames file, which contains a principal name and its password on each line, separated by #one or more spaces.

#The ank command adds a new key. ank is an alias for the add_principal command.

#The +needchange option configures the principal so that the user who is the principal is prompted for a new password at #first login.
